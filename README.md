# project_t - Written in Rust
I'm unsure on the direction this project will take, but it currently serves as a simsig style train simulation with *fairly* accurate physics for acceleration, top speed, and braking performance.
## Features:
- [x] 4-aspect signalling for multiple trains
- [x] adaptive speed limit for trains
- [x] individual throttle control for each train
- [x] parallel processing of train updates to improve performance (~800 updates per second currently achievable on my system)
- [ ] stations with multiple platforms
- [ ] timetable system
- [ ] automatic visualisation of network
- [ ] uk rail network scraping (possibly simulating real areas)
